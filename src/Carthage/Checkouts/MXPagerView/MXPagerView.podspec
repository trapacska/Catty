                        MXPagerView is a pager view with the ability to reuse pages like you would do with a table view and cells. 
                        The MXPagerView also loads pages lazily, depending on the transition style, it will load the current page and neighbors and unload others pages.

                        MXPagerViewController allows you to load pages from storyboard using the MXPageSegue.
